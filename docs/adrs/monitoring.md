# ADR 001: Monitoring and Observability Setup

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Real-Time Chat System (RTCS) requires comprehensive monitoring and observability to ensure system reliability, performance, and quick issue detection. We need to collect and visualize metrics at both the application and infrastructure levels, with centralized logging for traceability.

## Decision

We will implement a monitoring stack using:
1. Prometheus for metrics collection
2. Grafana for visualization and alerting
3. OpenSearch for centralized logging
4. Node Exporter for host metrics

### Components

#### Prometheus
- Used as the metrics collection and storage system
- Scrapes metrics from the application and Node Exporter
- Stores time-series data for historical analysis
- Provides a query language (PromQL) for data analysis

#### Grafana
- Used for visualization and alerting
- Connects to Prometheus and OpenSearch as data sources
- Provides customizable dashboards
- Supports alerting with multiple notification channels

#### OpenSearch
- Used for centralized logging
- Provides full-text search capabilities
- Supports log aggregation and analysis
- Integrates with Grafana for visualization

#### Node Exporter
- Collects host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Exposes metrics in Prometheus format
- Runs as a separate container

### Metrics Collected

1. Application Metrics:
   - HTTP request rates and durations
   - WebSocket connection count
   - Message rates
   - Error rates
   - Database operation metrics
   - Redis operation metrics

2. Infrastructure Metrics:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk I/O
   - Network traffic

3. Logs:
   - Application logs
   - Error logs
   - Access logs
   - System logs

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Comprehensive visibility into system performance
2. Early detection of issues through alerts
3. Historical data for trend analysis
4. Centralized logging for easier debugging
5. Scalable monitoring solution

### Negative
1. Additional resource consumption
2. Increased system complexity
3. Need for maintenance of monitoring infrastructure
4. Learning curve for team members

### Mitigations
1. Resource usage is optimized through proper configuration
2. Documentation and training provided for team members
3. Monitoring stack is containerized for easy deployment
4. Alerts are configured to prevent alert fatigue

## Alternatives Considered

1. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Rejected due to higher resource requirements
   - More complex setup and maintenance

2. Datadog
   - Rejected due to cost considerations
   - Less control over data

3. CloudWatch
   - Rejected due to vendor lock-in
   - Limited customization options

## Implementation Notes

1. All components are containerized using Docker
2. Metrics are exposed at `/metrics` endpoint
3. Dashboards are provisioned automatically
4. Alerts are configured for critical thresholds
5. Logs are structured for better analysis
