# ADR 002: Testing Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Real-Time Chat System (RTCS) requires comprehensive testing to ensure reliability, performance, and maintainability. We need to implement various types of tests to cover different aspects of the system, from unit tests to load testing.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy using:

1. Unit Tests
   - Using Go's testing package
   - Mock dependencies using gomock
   - Target 80% code coverage
   - Focus on business logic

2. Integration Tests
   - Test API endpoints
   - Test database interactions
   - Test Redis caching
   - Use testcontainers-go for isolated testing

3. Contract Tests
   - Use Pact for contract testing
   - Test API and WebSocket interactions
   - Ensure service compatibility

4. Load/Stress Tests
   - Use k6 for load testing
   - Test with 1000 concurrent users
   - Measure response times and error rates
   - Test WebSocket performance

### Testing Tools

#### Unit Testing
- Go's built-in testing package
- testify for assertions
- gomock for mocking
- go test -cover for coverage

#### Integration Testing
- testcontainers-go for containerized testing
- httptest for HTTP testing
- Custom test helpers

#### Contract Testing
- Pact Go for contract testing
- Consumer-driven contracts
- Provider verification

#### Load Testing
- k6 for load testing
- Custom test scenarios
- Performance metrics collection

### Test Organization

```

├── unit/
│   ├── service/
│   ├── repository/
│   └── transport/
├── integration/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── websocket/
│   └── database/
├── contract/
│   ├── consumer/
│   └── provider/
└── load/

    └── results/
```

## Consequences

### Positive
1. High code quality and reliability
2. Early bug detection
3. Performance validation
4. Service compatibility assurance
5. Automated testing pipeline

### Negative
1. Increased development time
2. Additional maintenance overhead
3. Learning curve for new tools
4. Resource requirements for testing

### Mitigations
1. Automated test execution
2. Clear documentation
3. Team training
4. Optimized test execution

## Alternatives Considered

1. Manual Testing
   - Rejected due to time-consuming nature
   - Prone to human error

2. Third-party Testing Services
   - Rejected due to cost
   - Less control over testing process

3. Custom Testing Framework
   - Rejected due to maintenance overhead
   - Less community support

## Implementation Notes

1. Tests are organized by type and component
2. CI/CD pipeline runs tests automatically
3. Coverage reports are generated
4. Test data is isolated
5. Performance benchmarks are tracked
